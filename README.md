## Unity 1: Sounds
In the menu scene of my game, I added the campfire sound, ambient noise, and gunshot. This way, there are sounds that loop and react to the player's actions.

## Unity 2: Reverb Zones
In the menu scene of my game, I added a "quarry" reverb zone to add a bit of reverb to the scene.

The target practice scene has a "city" reverb zone to fit the style of a more populated area.

The wave mode scene has a "stone" reverb zone when on top of the stone area in the middle of the map to immerse the player more to the changing environment that they are given.
